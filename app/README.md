# audapolis electron app
This directory contains the code for the main audapolis electron app that is the user facing component of audapolis.

The boilerplate was created using `npx create-electron-app app --template=typescript-webpack` and therefore uses `webpack` and `electron-squirrel` for the build process.
Technology-wise, `react` and `typescript` are used.
